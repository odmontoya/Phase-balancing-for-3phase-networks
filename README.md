Title: On the exact formulation of the optimal phase-balancing in three-phase unbalanced networks: two alternative MINLP models.

Abstrac: This article presents two novel MINLP formulations in the complex variable domain to address the optimal phase-balancing problem in asymmetric three-phase distribution networks. The first formulation employs a matrix-based representation to model all possible load connections, while the second uses a compact vector-based representation. Both models integrate power flow equations through the current injection method, accurately capturing nonlinearities associated with load demands in Delta and Wye configurations. By solving these formulations with an interior-point optimizer combined with a branch-and-cut algorithm implemented in Julia software, the proposed methods guarantee globally optimal solutions while maintaining computational efficiency. Numerical validations on 8-, 25-, and 37-node test feeders demonstrated significant improvements in power loss reductions—24.3388~\%, 4.1641~\%, and 19.2563~\%, respectively—compared to state-of-the-art metaheuristic techniques and convex approximations. Additionally, the M-MINLP formulation outperformed the V-MINLP approach in processing times, solving the 8-node system 15.6 times faster and the 37-node system 2.5 times faster. These results highlight the robustness and scalability of the proposed methods, particularly for medium and large systems, where existing techniques often fail to converge to the global optimum. The proposed formulations advance the state of the art by combining exact mathematical modeling with efficient computational strategies, making them valuable for researchers and practitioners seeking precise, scalable, and practical tools for optimizing power distribution networks.  All computational validations were performed using Julia software version $1.10.2$, the JuMP optimization environment version $1.21.1$, and the AmplNLWriter version $1.2.1$.
